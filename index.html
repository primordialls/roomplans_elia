                    <h3>Random Points (Uniform)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Generated by uniform distribution in a radius of 100 units around correct point.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong>  I will supply a list of 10 floor plans in COCO format.
                        Each one has 1 point moved from the rest.
                        Your task is to figure out which point has been moved,
                        and restore it to the original location by averaging the incorrect points.
                        Return the output JSON with the corrected point in the same format.</p>

                        Your task is to figure out which point has been moved,
                        and restore it to the original location, based on best judgement and pattern recognition.

                    <p><strong>Claude explanation:</strong> I've analyzed the floor plans in COCO format and found that the point that has been moved is the second point in the segmentation array of annotation ID 2791 (the large area on the right side of the floor plan).
                        Looking at all 10 variations, I noticed this specific point follows a circular pattern, with values ranging from:<br/>
                        [643.0, 667.0]<br/>
                        [637.2705098312484, 684.6335575687742]<br/>
                        [622.2705098312484, 695.5316954888546]<br/>
                        [603.7294901687516, 695.5316954888547]<br/>
                        [588.7294901687516, 684.6335575687742]<br/>
                        [583.0, 667.0]<br/>
                        [588.7294901687516, 649.3664424312258]<br/>
                        [603.7294901687516, 638.4683045111454]<br/>
                        [622.2705098312484, 638.4683045111453]<br/>
                        [637.2705098312484, 649.3664424312258]<br/>
                        Based on architectural principles and pattern recognition, the most logical original position would be [613.0, 667.0].</p>
